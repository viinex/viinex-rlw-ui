This is a test/demo UI for railcar ID number recognition application build with Viinex video management SDK.

This UI has support for monitoring of live events coming from railcar ID recognition system, for controlling the system (e.g. sending the commands to start recognition and stop recognition by pressing a button in the UI), as well as accessing historical recognition results. The latter may be stored in RAM of controlling script or, as of Viinex build 470, in the Viinex events database.

For more information please refer to generic documentation on Viinex (https://viinex.com/ViinexGuide.pdf) and to the documentation specific for railcar ID number recognition application (https://viinex.com/ViinexRailwayGuide.pdf).
